	<h2>Into the wild</h2>
	<p>Into the Wild is a book about a man who hitchhiked into the wild and was forced to survive off of the available resources. </p>
	</br>
	<p>Our team made a rudimentary child friendly website that easily allows the user to access more information on certain wildlife topics.</p>
	<li>Topics Included
		<ul>Amazon River</ul>
		<ul>Parrots</ul>
		<ul>Rolling Rapids</ul>
		<ul>Turtles</ul>
		<ul>Polar Bears</ul>
		<ul>Mountains</ul>
		<ul>Lau Thailand Waterfall	</ul>
        <ul>Camel	</ul>
		</li>

	
    **PS** Our original coding project didn't work out. 
	However, we still decided to take an approach that none of us were familiar with.
	Due to a lack of knowledge on front end coding we know it's not the most competitive work but we tried our best :)
